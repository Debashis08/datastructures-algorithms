## Data Structures and Algorithms  

This repository contains a collection of **data structures and algorithms** implemented in **C++**. It is designed to provide efficient solutions to common algorithmic problems while adhering to clean coding practices and modular design.  

### Features  

- **Data Structures and Algorithms:** Implementations of data structures and algorithms based on the concepts from the book ***Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (CLRS).***
- **Modular Design:** Code is organized into manageable modules for better readability and reusability.  
- **Testing:**  
  - Built with **CMake** as the build system for ease of compilation and dependency management.  
  - **Google Test** framework is integrated for comprehensive unit testing to ensure code correctness.
